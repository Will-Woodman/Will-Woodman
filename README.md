I'm Will, a PhD student in statistics at Newcastle University working with Dr Tom Nye. I will be working on BHV tree space, aiming to fit probability distributions to data. BHV tree space was defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann in 

Methods exist for computing FrÃ©chet means in BHV space and normal distributions can be created on BHV tree space by simulating Brownian Motion, e.g....
However, no methods existing for inferring the parameters of an normal distribution given data. This is what my research will focus on.
