I'm Will, a PhD student in statistics at Newcastle University working with Dr Tom Nye. I will be working on BHV tree space, aiming to fit probability distributions to data. BHV tree space was defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196885801907596.

Methods exist for computing Fr√©chet means in BHV space and normal distributions can be created on BHV tree space by simulating Brownian Motion.
However, no methods existing for inferring the parameters of a normal distribution given data. This is what my research will focus on.
